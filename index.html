        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: NLP, MLOps, and AIOps</li>
            <li>ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Data Science, Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, MLOps</li>
            <li>âš¡ Fun fact: Data scientists spend about 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data, and only 20% actually analyzing it. So, if you think data science is all about making groundbreaking discoveries, think againâ€”it's mostly about scrubbing dirty data!</li>
